"""ATK N9 V2 receivers, battery-only Bolutek protocol (verification C).

Facts from ATK Hub 3.2.31; see upstream-protocols.md. Only the two diagnosed
receiver IDs and FF90:0001 are enabled. Report 55 must be proven per ID by
the runtime descriptor: output 64 bytes, input 22..64 bytes including ID.
The source requires at least 21 input payload bytes, not a fixed input size;
64 is our conservative receive ceiling. The actual reply must match its caps.

No initialization, register binding, feature, EQ, pairing or OTA commands.
Initial N9 Ultra 373B:1204 uses a different serial protocol and is not enabled.
