"""Pulsar, ATK, VXE, VGN and Hitscan mice over USB/HID, without vendor software.

MyFinder extension: unlisted ATK VID 373B devices may use protocol-family matching
(协议族匹配，未实测; level C). Only FF02:0002 with a known output length of exactly
17 bytes receives the existing power query. N9 headset IDs 1204/1262/12D6 are
excluded before collection/length probing. FF04/FF05 alone and unknown lengths
are not sufficient. Exact 373B:1216 uses the separate, descriptor-guarded
FF05 BITMOUSE reader below; it never enters the legacy FF02/DPI path.
DPI uses a separate exact allow-list below; the server keeps
native 373B:1278 excluded. Scyrox 3554:F517, VGN F2 Master+ 3554:FB56 and
VXE R1 SE 1K 3554:F58E also require FF02:0002 and exactly 17 output bytes;
they are pending hardware verification in this project. VGN Dragonfly 4K
3554:F505 uses the same strict collection/length guards; the project maintainer
read 35%, not charging, 3766 mV on a VGN F1 Pro (VGN HUB: 36%) on 2026-11-05.
Charging transitions and sleep/wake remain untested. Other listed models retain
their original selection rules. See upstream-protocols.md for ID evidence.
Pulsar Link 8K 3710:5501 additionally requires descriptor-proven input/output
report 8, each exactly 17 bytes, on FF02:0002. Its web-driver parser requires
status zero and treats charging as exactly 1; only battery reads are enabled (C).

Protocol from andrewrabert/python-pulsar-mouse-tool, which also backs the
"HID: pulsar" driver in review for the Linux kernel and lists these ids:

  * 3554:f508  Pulsar X2 V2 Mini (1 kHz dongle)      3554:f507  the same mouse on the cable
  * 3554:f58f  ATK VXE R1 SE+ (wired)                373b:1085  ATK VXE R1 SE+ (2.4 GHz)
  * 3554:f58a  VXE R1 Pro Max (1 kHz dongle, #87)    3554:f58c  the same mouse on its cable
  * 3710:5406  Pulsar X2 CrazyLight Mini (2.4 GHz)   3710:3414  the same mouse on the cable
  * the Kysona M600 and the VXE Dragonfly R1 Pro use the same protocol (their ids are
    not in the tool, so they are not claimed here).

The cable id (3554:f58c) is claimed too, from the reporter's second report in #87: the
wired mouse lists the same eight collections as the receiver, and the panel below reads it
with the same command 0x04 frame. Both transports are confirmed on that reporter's
hardware - the receiver read the mouse's level, and on the cable the level agreed with
ATK's own panel (hub.atk.pro) and the charging flag followed the cable.

The ATK and Compx builds are also handled by the OpenMouse project's ATK/VXE panel
(@openmouse/protocol, drivers/atk): it lists 3554:f58a for the R1 Pro Max receiver
and 3554:f58c for the same mouse on its cable, and reads the battery with command
0x04, taking the level, the flag and the millivolts from the same three places this
file does. It also opens the collection with usage page 0xFF02 and usage 0x0002,
which is why that one is preferred below.

The same 17-byte framing is in G-Wolves' own web driver (mouse.xyz), which also handles
these Compx-based receivers: its get_Crc() is 0x55 minus the sum of the first fifteen
payload bytes, the result goes in byte 15, and the frame is sent with sendReport(8, ...) -
so the frame on the wire sums to 0x55, the rule this file uses. (Its battery read is for
the G-Wolves protocol; the level offsets here rest on the two sources above.)

The Hitscan Hyperlight speaks the same frame, on the same kind of vendor collection
(ff02:0002): sopparus/hitscan-battery mapped it from USBPcap captures of Hitscan Utility
1.0.2 in both cable (3770:0100) and receiver (3770:0200) mode and reads it with a plain
write()/read(), command 0x04, the level in byte 6, the flag in byte 7, checksum 0x55 minus
the sum. Its notes left byte 8 and byte 9 unresolved; across its captures those read
0x1129 (4393 mV) while charging and 0x1073 (4211 mV) on battery - the big-endian millivolt
field this file already reads. Its own warning also applies: the vendor application's
battery indicator is broken (it showed 100 % while the device answered 75), so the raw
byte is the truth, which is what this file reports.

A mouse that is idle stops answering - the receiver goes quiet a few seconds after the
last movement, and the wired collection does the same while the mouse sits on its
cable - so a silent poll is a normal state and not a device that went away. The last
reading is kept greyed out for as long as the mouse's receiver stays in the USB tree,
however long the mouse sleeps, and it refreshes at the first poll the mouse answers
again; only a receiver that leaves the tree drops the device, icon included. #87
first showed the icon vanishing around the mouse's cable, then that after the mouse's
own deep stop-mode (10-15 idle minutes) the reading took a long time to come back; a
later screen-off report showed that dropping the icon also cost it its tray position
(Windows puts a re-created icon at a new spot), so the greyed value no longer
expires on a timer.

Frames are 17 bytes, big-endian, report id 0x08:

    [0] 0x08      header, which is also the report id
    [1] command   0x04 = power details
    [2..15]        arguments, zero for a power query
    [16] checksum 0x55 - the sum of bytes 0..15, mod 256

A power reply carries the level in byte 6, the power flag in byte 7 (the mouse is on
its cable) and millivolts big-endian in bytes 8-9. The same endpoint also pushes
events (command 0x0a), so a reply is only accepted when the header and the checksum
both check out, the command is the one we asked for, and the level is 0..100.
