"""Angry Miao AM Infinity 8K on its 2.4 GHz receiver/basetta (3151:5007).

Protocol from the AJAZZ Control Center project (Aiacos/ajazz-control-center,
GPL-3.0): its "AJ-series mouse battery" write-up and the byte table it cites.
That project reads the same USB id on its own hardware - the AJAZZ AJ159 APEX
(2.4G 8K) per its device matrix; the receiver of an AM Infinity enumerates as
'AM INFINITY 8K MOUSE' with the identical six collections.

The charge is not a one-shot query. The basetta (the receiver the mouse pairs
to over 2.4 GHz) mirrors the mouse's charge into its status feature report
only after it receives the vendor's ~1 Hz status poll, so the read is a
two-step sequence on the usage page 0xFFFF / usage 0x02 control collection:

    request   feature report id 0x00:  00 F7 00 ... (zero payload)
    wait      ~30 ms for the 2.4G round-trip
    reply     feature report 0x05:     05 00 00 64 01 01 01 02   (Windows)

The charge is the byte after the report id and the zero padding (byte 3 on
Windows hidapi; byte 2 for an unnumbered Linux read - auto-detected). A
non-zero byte before the charge is junk a wireless reconnect can return and
is refused; a charge of 0 means the link is not up yet and is reported as
unknown, never as a wrong 0 %. The reference ships the 65-byte poll in its
app and tries both 65 and 67 in its hardware probe, so both are tried here.
The status report carries no charging flag, so none is shown. Nothing else
is ever written to the device.

**Unverified** on the AM Infinity itself: the exchange is hardware-confirmed
by the reference project on its own unit; the receiver of #72 has to answer
once for this layout to be confirmed too.
