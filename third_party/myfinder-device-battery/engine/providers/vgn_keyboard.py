"""VGN 320F:5088 keyboard receiver, from VGN HUB and a maintainer capture.

Independent read-only battery query; no G3M checksum, settings or fallback.
Rainy75 shares this USB identity but is unverified; the product string cannot
distinguish it. Only descriptor-backed reports with the battery signature count.
Evidence and limits: engine/upstream-protocols.md.
