"""HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 over its 2.4 GHz station, without NGENUITY.

The station is two USB functions: 03F0:08BE ("Wireless Controller", which carries
the battery) and 03F0:0ABE ("Wireless Chat", isochronous audio only - there is
nothing to read there; a Device Manager listing can quote that half).

The battery exchange was decoded from two USBPcap captures of NGENUITY in issue
#26, taken at two different charge levels, and matched against the number
NGENUITY displayed at the time:

  * battery collection, usage page 0xFF13 / usage 0xFF00
  * request: 64-byte output report  50 02 00 00 ...   (0x50 is the report id)
  * reply:   the input report starting 51 02
        51 02 <level%> 00 1a 00 <flags> ...
      level = byte 2, a plain percentage: 0x33 = 51 and 0x43 = 67 in the two
              captures, matching NGENUITY both times
      flags = index 6; bit 7 was set after a recharge and clear before, so it is
              reported as charging (one capture each way)

Do not use the 61 02 frame: it is byte-identical across both charge levels, so it
is not the battery. While NGENUITY runs, the same channel carries thousands of
`ff 01` and `44`/`45` frames; stale reports are drained before the request and the
reply is read until it arrives, so the two applications can run at once. A reply that does not start 51 02 is ignored, and a level
above 100 is refused rather than shown as a made-up number.
